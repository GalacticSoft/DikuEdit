Advanced Mob Keyword Use:
-------------------------

  The following can be included in the mob keywords in order to add
characteristics that cannot currently be set in the editor.  They should be
used VERY SPARINGLY and should not be used unless absolutely necessary.  We
don't really like having these keywords in existence and think it's sloppy
code in general, but since it's something we inherited from Basternae 1,
we're grudgingly supporting it.

br_a  - Breathes Acid
br_c  - Breathes Cold
br_f  - Breathes Fire
br_g  - Breathes Gas
br_l  - Breathes Lightning
br_s  - Breathes Shadow
br_w  - Breathes something that starts with "W"

_size_none_       - None
_size_tiny_       - Tiny
_size_small_      - Small
_size_petite_     - Small
_size_average_    - Medium
_size_medium_     - Medium
_size_large_      - Large
_size_huge_       - Huge
_size_giant_      - Giant
_size_titanic_    - Titanic
_size_gargantuan_ - Gargantuan

_nomoney_    - Mob does not spawn with coins.

_multiclass_ - Mob is more than one class.  Must be followed by a class keyword.

Class keywords are:

_warrior_
_sorcerer_
_psionicist_
_cleric_
_thief_
_assassin_
_mercenary_
_paladin_
_anti-paladin_
_ranger_
_shaman_
_druid_
_bard_
_hunter_
_illusionist_
_monk_
_necromancer_
_chronomancer_
_warlock_
_enslaver_
_air_elementalist_
_earth_elementalist_
_fire_elementalist_
_water_elementalist_
_shipwright_

So if you wanted to create a mob that was a huge firebreather, you'd set the keywords like this:

Mob name:  an angry chicken
Keywords:   chicken angry br_f _size_huge_
